#Island Count# 

""" 
    Given a 2D array binaryMatrix of 0s and 1s, implement a function 
    getNumberOfIslands that returns the number of islands of 1s in binaryMatrix.

    An island is defined as a group of adjacent values that are all 1s. A cell 
    in binaryMatrix is considered adjacent to another cell if they are next to each 
    either on the same row or column. Note that two values of 1 are not part of the
    same island if theyâ€™re sharing only a mutual corner (i.e. they are diagonally 
    neighbors).

    Explain and code the most efficient solution possible and analyze its time and 
    space complexities

    Example: 
    input:  binaryMatrix = [ [0,    1,    0,    1,    0],
                             [0,    0,    1,    1,    1],
                             [1,    0,    0,    1,    0],
                             [0,    1,    1,    0,    0],
                             [1,    0,    1,    0,    1] ]
    output: 6 # since this is the number of islands in binaryMatrix.
              # See all 6 islands color-coded below.
