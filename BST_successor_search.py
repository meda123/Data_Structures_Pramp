Solution

Let’s denote the Inorder Successor of inputNode as successorNode. To arrive to 
the solution, we distinguish between two cases:

inputNode has a right child. In this case successorNode would be the node with 
the minimum key in inputNode's right subtree.

inputNode doesn’t have a right child. In this case successorNode would be one 
of inputNode's ancestors. More specifically, within inputNode's ancestor chain 
(starting from inputNode all the way up to the root), successorNode is the first
 parent that has a left child in that chain.

If inputNode doesn’t have a right child and all of its ancestors are right 
children to their parents, inputNode doesn’t have a successor 
(successorNode would be null).

So why is this always true? Well, if inputNode was inserted to the tree prior 
to successorNode, then since successorNode.key is greater than inputNode.key, 
but also smaller than all other keys greater than successorNode.key, 
successorNode has to be in inputNode's right subtree.

Now, if inputNode was inserted to the tree after successorNode was, then since 
inputNode.key is smaller than successorNode.key, but also larger than all other 
keys smaller than successorNode.key, inputNode has to be in successorNode's left subtree.

PSEUDOCODE 

function findInOrderSuccessor(inputNode):
    if (inputNode.right != null):
        # return the node with minimum key in the right subtree
        return findMinKeyWithinTree(inputNode.right)

    ancestor = inputNode.parent
    child = inputNode

    # travel up using the parent pointer until you see
    # a node which is the left child of its parent. The parent
    # of such a node is successorNode.
    while (ancestor != null AND child == ancestor.right):
        child = ancestor
        ancestor = child.parent

    return ancestor

function findMinKeyWithinTree(inputNode):
    while (inputNode.left != null):
        inputNode = inputNode.left

    return inputNode


Time Complexity: in both cases where either inputNode has a right child or 
doesn’t have one, we are visiting only O(H) number of nodes, where H is the 
height of the BST. For a balanced BST, since H = log(N), where N is the number 
of nodes in the BST, the time complexity is O(log(N)). For an unbalanced BST, 
the time complexity is O(N).

Space Complexity: throughout the entire algorithm we used only a constant 
amount of space, hence the space complexity is O(1).
